# Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

# Note:
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

# Example 1:

# Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
# Output: 1

# Example 2:

# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
# Output: 3

# Follow up:
# What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
